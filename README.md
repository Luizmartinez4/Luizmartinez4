  <summary><h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªAbout Me</h3></summary>

  - üí¨ Hello! My name is Luiz, I‚Äôm 19 years old, and I‚Äôm currently studying Software Engineering. I'm in my third semester at university. I've been passionate about software development, and I‚Äôve dedicated myself to studying beyond the university curriculum. I‚Äôve taken some online courses on platforms like Alura, Rocketseat, and Udemy, which helped me deepen my understanding of different programming languages, tools, and frameworks.

  - ‚ö° In terms of professional experience, I started my career as a young apprentice at SENAI, working as an electromechanical operator. Although it was a technical position, it gave me a solid foundation in mechanics, problem-solving, and how to work efficiently in a structured environment. After completing the fundamentals in that area, I decided to move toward my real passion‚Äîtechnology and development.

  - üå± So I transitioned into a support role at a company called Bergamin & Cia, where I‚Äôm currently working as an intern. My responsibilities there include technical support, system testing, and occasionally helping with software development tasks. This role has been a great learning experience and has helped me improve both my technical and interpersonal skills.
